<== IAM ==>
  :- IAM = Identity and Access Management, Global service
  :- Users are people within your organization, and can be grouped
  :- Groups only contain users, not other groups
  :- Users don’t have to belong to a group, and user can belong to multiple groups
  :- Users or Groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies
  :- These policies are the permissions of the users
  what's the AWS CLI?
    A tool that enables you to interact with AWS services using commands in your command-line shell
    IAM Roles for Services
  :- Some AWS service will need to perform actions on your behalf
  :- To do so, we will assign permissions to AWS services with IAM Roles
  :- Common roles: • EC2 Instance Roles • Lambda Function Roles • Roles for CloudFormation
  
<== EC2 ==>
  Compute Optimized
  :- Batch processing Workloads
  :- High performance web servers
  :- High performance computing
  Memory Optimized
  :- Applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data
  :- High performance, relational/non-relational databases
  Storage Optimized
  :- High frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems
  :- Data warehousing applications
  
<== Security Groups ==>
  :- Security Groups are the fundamental of network security in AWS
  :- They control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 Instances
  :- Security Groups are statuful 
  :- It simply means if you allow say outbound rule on particular port protocol ip address it will allow to get back. So whatever comes in comes out.
  :- Security groups only contain rule
  :- Can be attached to multiple instances
  :- All inbound traffic is blocked by default
  :- All outbound traffic is authorised by default
  
<== Classic Ports to know ==>
:- 22 = SSH (Secure Shell) - log into a Linux instance
:- 21 = FTP (File Transfer Protocol) – upload files into a file share
:- 22 = SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) – upload files using SSH
:- 80 = HTTP – access unsecured websites
:- 443 = HTTPS – access secured websites
:- 3389 = RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) – log into a Windows instance

EC2 Instances purchase options
On Demand 
  :- Recommended for short-term and un-interrupted workloads, where you can't predict how the application will behave
  :- Has the highest cost but no upfront payment
  :- No long-term commitment
EC2 Reserved Instances
  :- Up to 72% discount compared to On-demand
  :- long workloads with flexible instances
  :- Recommended for steady-state usage applications
EC2 Spot Instances
  :- Can get a discount of up to 90% compared to On-demand
  :- Instances that you can “lose” at any point of time if your max price is less than the current spot price
  :- Image processing
  :- Workloads with a flexible start and end time
EC2 Dedicated Hosts
  :- Workloads with a flexible start and end time
  :- Instances run on hardware that’s dedicated to you
  :- May share hardware with other instances in same account
  :- No control over instance placement (can move hardware after Stop / Start)

Which purchasing option is right for me?
• On demand: coming and staying in resort whenever we like, we pay the full price
• Reserved: like planning ahead and if we plan to stay for a long time, we may get a good discount.
• Savings Plans: pay a certain amount per hour for certain period and stay in any room type (e.g., 
  King, Suite, Sea View, …)
• Spot instances: the hotel allows people to bid for the empty rooms and the highest bidder keeps the 
  rooms. You can get kicked out at any time
• Dedicated Hosts: We book an entire building of the resort
• Capacity Reservations: you book a room for a period with full price even you don’t stay in it

<== Elastic IPs ==>
:- When you stop and then start an EC2 instance, it can change its public IP
:- If you need to have a fixed public IP for your instance, you need an Elastic IP
:- An Elastic IP is a public IPv4 IP you own as long as you don’t delete it
:- You can attach it to one instance at a time
:- You can only have 5 Elastic IP in your account (you can ask AWS to increase that)

<== EC2 – Understanding vCPU ==>
:- Multiple threads can run on one CPU (multithreading)
:- Each thread is represented as a virtual CPU (vCPU)
   • Example: m5.2xlarge
   • 4 CPU
   • 2 threads per CPU
   • 8 vCPU in total
   
<== EBS ==>
:- An EBS (Elastic Block Store) Volume is a network drive you can attach to your instances while they run
:- It allows your instances to persist data, even after their termination
:- They can only be mounted to one instance at a time (at the CCP level)
:- They are bound to a specific availability zone
:- An EBS Volume in us-east-1a cannot be attached to us-east-1b
:- To move a volume across, you first need to snapshot it

<== EBS Snapshots ==>
:- Make a backup (snapshot) of your EBS volume at a point in time
:- Not necessary to detach volume to do snapshot, but recommended
:- Can copy snapshots across AZ or Region

<== AMI Overview ==>
:- Amazon Machine Image are a customization of an EC2 instance
:- You add your own software, configuration, operating system, monitoring…
:- Faster boot / configuration time because all your software is pre-packaged
:- AMI are built for a specific region (and can be copied across regions)
:- Start an EC2 instance and customize it
:- Build an AMI – this will also create EBS snapshots

<== EBS Volume Types ==>
  • EBS Volumes come in 6 types
  • gp2 / gp3 (SSD): General purpose SSD volume that balances price and performance for 
    a wide variety of workloads
  • io1 / io2 (SSD): Highest-performance SSD volume for mission-critical low-latency or 
    high-throughput workloads
  • st1 (HDD): Low cost HDD volume designed for frequently accessed, throughput- intensive workloads
  • sc1 (HDD): Lowest cost HDD volume designed for less frequently accessed workloads
